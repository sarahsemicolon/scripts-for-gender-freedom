# Asking someone's pronouns

## Over Slack / in conversation

When: In introducing oneself to someone new
What: Hi, I'm Janet Jackson, and I go by `they/them` pronouns. How should I refer to you?

When: For someone you already know
What: By the way, I use `he/him` pronouns. How should I refer to you?

# Correcting someone who misgenders someone else

## During a meeting

### Respond in the moment

When: Once the person who's just got the pronouns incorrect has finished talking
How: Verbally
What: Just to point out, I'm pretty sure their pronouns are they/them

### Respond async

Where: Slack DM, email etc.
What: FYI, I think you used "she" to refer to Sarah and I'm pretty sure their pronouns are they/them :)

## Via Slack/email

Where: In a direct message to that person (Slack DM, email, i.e. not in the initial thread itself to avoid derailing conversation if it happened in a group conversation)
What: FYI, I'm pretty sure Sarah uses they/them pronouns :)

# When you get pronouns wrong

## If you realise during the interaction

When: In speech, not as a big deal
How: Verbally
What: Sorry, I just realised I've been getting your pronouns wrong.

## If you realise later

Where: In a direct message to that person (Slack DM, email etc.)
What: Hey, I realised / got told I got your pronouns wrong earlier, sorry. I'm try and sometimes I mess up but I know it's important and I'll keep working at it. Feel free to point out if it seems I've forgotten.
