# Correcting someone who misgenders me 
## Remote meetings

* When: During a remote meeting, while people are talking, ideally as soon as someone has done it.
* Where: In the chat for the remote meeting
* What: `*they :)`

## Slack/email

* When: As soon as I notice.
* Where: In a direct message to that person (Slack DM, email, i.e. not in the initial thread itself to avoid derailing conversation).
* What: `Hey :) Just for awareness: I'm non-binary, and I use they/them pronouns.`

## IRL meetings

* When: Immediately after the meeting.
* Where: Taking the person who made the mistake aside, if possible. "Walk-and-talk" to coffee/lunch or wherever you're going.
* What: `Hey! Just for awareness: I'm non-binary, and I use they/them pronouns.`
